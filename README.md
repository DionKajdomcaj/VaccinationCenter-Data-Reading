# VaccinationCenter-Data-Reading
During emergency situation we should register for vaccination. We can do it using an application giving some data. 

The applicant has to give his/her name, date of birth and the phone number. Besides this data we can give whether we want to get it free or it is acceptable to pay extra charge for it.  (e.g. Vaci Nation, 1953, 36301234567, yes)

 We have to store the data in file.  Implement the given functionalities: to add new data,  modify data, delete data or create total list.
